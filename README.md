# JSCalculator
A JavaScript, HTML and CSS based Calculator application. This program should be seen as more of a personal learning project rather than an actual tool with a use.

Made possible by 'Bro Code' on YouTube. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5kj-YsmWjM]

This application should be seen as a stepping stone for my coding abilities, since now I understand how front-end and back-end coding apply to programming by including several coding languages, each with a certain job to do.

# What I have learned from this
So, This project has taught me how HTML can be given a glow-up with the use of CSS, and a function with JavaScript, since traditional HTML is known to be ugly. 

This project has taught me the uses of CSS, and should be a reference point for future JavaScript and HTML projects.

With the help of ChatGPT, i figured out how to get light mode and dark mode on the site, and I figured out how to get moving animations, and fading color animations.

I once visioned HTML as an old looking, janky feeling language to make horrible websites which are ugly and impractical, but now I understand, you can make it look splendid with some CSS. You can do almost anything with HTML and CSS, Wow!
